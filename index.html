                    <h3>RELEASE OF LIABILITY AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK</h3>
                    <p class="intro">
                        The individual named below (referred to as “I” or “me”) desires to participate in Salon Service (the “Activity") which
                        shall be provided by Mia’s Wax Studio (the “Company). As lawful consideration for the value that I will gain by
                        participating in the Activity, I agree to all the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement (this “Agreement").
                        <br><br>
                        I AM AWARE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE ACTIVITIES ARE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ACTIVITIES AND INVOLVE
                        THE RISK OF SERIOUS ILLNESS, INJURY AND/OR DEATH. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM AWARE OF THE COVID-19
                        VIRUS AND ITS ABILITY TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM PERSON-TO-PERSON CONTACT. I AM ALSO AWARE THAT
                        ANY PERSON MAY CARRY THE VIRUS AND BE ASYMPTOMATIC. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPANY CANNOT
                        GUARANTEE THAT I WILL NOT BECOME INFECTED WITH COVID-19, DESPITE THE COMPANY’S BEST EFFORTS
                        TO ABIDE BY STATE AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES SURROUNDING COVID-19. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM
                        VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING IN THE ACTIVITIES WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE DANGER OF ILLNESS INVOLVED
                        AND HEREBY AGREE TO ACCEPT AND ASSUME ANY AND ALL RISKS OF ILLNESS, INJURY, OR DEATH.
                        <br><br>
                        I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE BEEN PRACTICING THE REQUIRED SAFETY PROTOCOLS OF COVID-19 AND AM TAKING
                        ALL THE PRECAUTIONS SERIOUSLY. I CERTIFY TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THE FOLLOWING: I DO NOT
                        HAVE A FEVER. I AM SHOWING NO SYMPTOMS INCLUDING SHORTNESS OF BREATH, LOSS OF SENSE OF TASTE
                        OR SMELL, DRY COUGH, SORE THROAT. NO ONE IN MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY HAS HAD A FEVER, COUGH, OR HAS
                        BEEN SICK IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS. I HAVE NOT TRAVELED OUT OF MINNESOTA IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS.
                        NO ONE IN MY IMMEDIATELY FAMILY HAS TRAVELED OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA IN THE PAST TWO
                        WEEKS. I AM AWARE THAT IF I SHOW UP TO MY APPOINTMENT WITHOUT A PROTECTIVE MASK, I WILL BE
                        TURNED AWAY FOR SERVICE.
                        <br>
                        I hereby expressly waive and release any and all claims, now known or hereafter known, against the Company, and its
                        officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and assigns (collectively, "Releasees"), on account of
                        illness, injury, or death arising out of or attributable to my participation in the Activities. I agree not to make or bring any
                        such claim against the Company or any other Releasee, and forever release and discharge the Company and all other
                        Releasees from liability under such claims.
                        I shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company and all other Releasees against any and all losses,
                        damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or
                        expenses of whatever kind, including attorney fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under
                        this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, arising out or resulting from any claim of a third
                        party related to the Activities.
                        <br><br>
                        This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire Agreement between the Company and me with respect to the subject
                        matter of release of liability and assumption of risk contained herein and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
                        understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject
                        matter. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
                        illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render
                        unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. This Agreement is binding on and shall inure to the
                        benefit of the Company and me and their respective successors and assigns. All matters arising out of or relating to
                        this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [Minnesota]
                        without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. Any claim or cause of action arising under this
                        Agreement may be brought only in the federal and state courts located in [Ramsey County], Minnesota] and I hereby
                        consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.
